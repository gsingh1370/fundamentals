Breadth-first Traversal
=======================

Breadth-first traversal is a method for walking through a tree or graph where you "fan out" as much as possible before going deeper. Your set of visited nodes will seem to "ripple outwards" from the starting point.

Breadth-first search or BFS uses breadth-first traversal to search for something in a tree or graph.

Breadth-first traversal is often compared with depth-first traversal.

## Advantages:

A BFS will not necessarily find a target as quickly as possible, but it will find the shortest path between the starting point and the target. A depth-first search will not necessarily find the shortest path.


## Disadvantages

A BFS on a binary tree generally requires more memory than a DFS.
