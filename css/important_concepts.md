### Block
A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to the left and right as far as it can. 
div is the standard block-level element. Other common block-level elements are p and form, and new in HTML5 are header, footer, section, and more.



### Inline elements:

respect left & right margins and padding, but not top & bottom

allow other elements to sit to their left and right.
see very important side notes on this here.

force a line break after the block element

### Inline-block elements:
